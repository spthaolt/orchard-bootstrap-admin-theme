Orchard Bootstrap Admin Theme
=============================

Extended admin theme for [Orchard framework](http://www.orchardproject.net/) which fully integrates the admin panel with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html), [jquery DataTables](http://datatables.net/), [jquery validationEngine](https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine), etc.
Great for custom development in Orchard framework in admin panel.

I've created also a module presenting sample of what you can achieve with this theme. You can obtain it here: [Bootstrap Orchard Admin Sample](https://github.com/yhnavein/orchard-bootstrap-admin-sample) and from the Orchard Gallery in the nearest future.

## Installation

1. Just clone repository to your **Themes** directory in your Orchard installation

	```
	git clone https://github.com/yhnavein/orchard-bootstrap-admin-theme.git BootstrapAdminTheme
	```

2. Login to your admin panel in your Orchard installation
3. Go to Themes and click Enable below the **Bootstrap Admin Theme**

**Warning!** Please **do not** click *Set as current* below **Bootstrap Admin Theme**

## Gallery

There were some serious problems with Orchard Gallery (well, they still exists, as no-one really cares about them), but I managed to upload this theme to Gallery and you can download and install this theme simply from Orchard. **Bootstrap Admin Theme** - is the name of theme in Gallery.

## Further development

This is only a custom admin theme and there are improvements that simply cannot be done only by extending theme.
Orchard framework also wasn't written in best way (in UX and design categories), so if you are willing for more improvements in this framework which fully integrates with Bootstrap please visit my Orchard fork where I am currently working on UX and design improvements.

**[Orchard Bootstrap Admin](http://orchard.codeplex.com/SourceControl/network/forks/Floubadour/OrchardBootstrapAdmin)** - fork of Orchard *v. 1.6*

Maybe it will be integrated in main Orchard one day...
